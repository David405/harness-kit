# SECURITY CHECKLIST — <FEATURE>

> Run by the Reviewer — a DIFFERENT instance than the one that wrote the code.
> MANDATORY for any feature touching money, authentication, user data, or
> external input. Skip only for provably low-stakes changes. Flag, don't fix.

## Authentication & authorization

- [ ] Every new endpoint/action enforces authn — no unintended public surface
- [ ] Authorization checked at the resource level (object-level, not just route-level)
- [ ] No privilege escalation path introduced (user cannot act as another user/role)
- [ ] Session/token handling unchanged or correctly scoped

## Input validation & injection

- [ ] All external input validated/typed at the boundary before use
- [ ] Parameterized queries / safe APIs — no string-built queries or commands
- [ ] Output encoded for its sink (HTML, SQL, shell, logs) to prevent injection
- [ ] File paths / identifiers from input cannot traverse or reference unintended resources

## Secrets & configuration

- [ ] No secrets, keys, or credentials in code, fixtures, logs, or error messages
- [ ] Secrets read from config/env only, never hardcoded or defaulted to a real value
- [ ] No new secret committed to the repo (verify the diff and git history)

## Rate limiting & abuse

- [ ] New write/expensive endpoints have rate limits or are covered by existing ones
- [ ] Idempotency preserved where required — no duplicate side effects on retry
- [ ] No unbounded resource consumption (pagination, size caps, timeouts)

## Error handling & data leakage

- [ ] Errors do not expose stack traces, secrets, internal IDs, or PII to clients
- [ ] Public/external responses never return fields meant to stay internal
- [ ] Failures are propagated or logged — nothing silently swallowed

## Dependencies & supply chain

- [ ] No new dependency added without need; each new one is reputable + pinned
- [ ] Dependency audit run (e.g. the project's audit tooling) — no known critical CVEs
- [ ] Lockfile updated and committed

## Production readiness

- [ ] Structured logging for the new path; no sensitive data logged
- [ ] Observability: the change is measurable/traceable in prod
- [ ] Rollback path exists (reversible migration, feature flag, or safe revert)
- [ ] Verify step from the contract passes against a prod-like configuration

## Verdict

- **Status:** APPROVE / CHANGES REQUESTED
- **Blocking security issues:** <numbered list, or "none">
- **Non-blocking notes:** <optional>
